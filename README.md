# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis






## Optimization
After many attempts, I was unable to hit the 75% accuracy for the model. Adding layers and neurons provided similar or even worse results than the original model which is obviously not ideal. I also tried to trim the INCOME_AMT column, but this did not affect much. I also tried binning the ASK_AMT, which did give a slight boost to the accuracy. In the end, the maximum accuracy I was able to achieve was 73%, but when the only change from the original file was binning the ASK_AMT column.
