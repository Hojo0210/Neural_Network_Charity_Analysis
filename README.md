## Optimization
After many attempts, I was unable to hit the 75% accuracy for the model. Adding layers and neurons provided similar or even worse results than the original model which is obviously not ideal. I also tried binning the asking amounts, which did give a slight boost to the accuracy. In the end, the maximum accuracy I was able to achieve was ----
